# BlueMacTriage

**BlueMacTriage** is a comprehensive Mac forensics triage bash script designed for Intel-based Macs. This script collects a variety of forensic data from a suspect system to assist in initial forensic investigations.

## Features

- Collects detailed system information
- Gathers user and group information
- Captures running processes and network connections
- Lists installed applications
- Collects system logs
- Retrieves browser history (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- Identifies persistence mechanisms (LaunchDaemons, LaunchAgents, cron jobs)
- Captures detailed network configurations
- Gathers disk and file system information
- Checks security settings (SIP, FileVault, Gatekeeper)
- Captures clipboard data
- Hashes important binaries and system files
- Zips the collected data and cleans up the temporary directory

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have root privileges to run the script:

```bash
sudo ./macTriage.sh
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fulco/BlueMacTriage.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd BlueMacTriage
```

3. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x macTriage.sh
```

### Running the Script

Run the script with root privileges:

```bash
sudo ./macTriage.sh
```

The script will create a directory in `/tmp` with the collected forensic data. The directory name will include the date and time the script was run, for example: `/tmp/mac_forensics_(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)`.

Once the data is collected, the script will zip the directory and save it as `/tmp/mac_forensics_(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).zip`. The temporary directory will then be cleaned up.
